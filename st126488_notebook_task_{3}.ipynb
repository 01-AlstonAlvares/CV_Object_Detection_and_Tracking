    "CF, CSRT, MOSSE, MIL, and TLD—were perfectly successful on this test. They all achieved a 100.00% success rate and had zero failed frames over the 40 frames tested. The main difference between them is clearly their speed, shown by the Average FPS. The MOSSE tracker is by far the fastest, with an extremely high performance of 837.41 FPS. KCF (156.93 FPS) and TLD (85.68 FPS) are also very fast, but CSRT (27.34 FPS) and MIL (23.99 FPS) are significantly slower in comparison. So, while all of them worked perfectly in terms of accuracy, MOSSE is the clear winner in terms of processing speed."
